Hello  there

How  are  you  feeling  ?

I  hope  you  are  fine  because  you  just  slept  for  a  very  long  time

Oh  you  do  not  have  any  memories ?

Let  me  tell  you  who  you  are

Your  name  is  Link  you  are  a  hero  from  the  past

If  you  woke  up  now  it must  be  for  an  important  matter

Now  hurry  up  and  go  talk  to  that  lady  outside
#
Good  morning

I  just  need  to  give  you  a  reminder  on  how  you  do actions

-Arrow keys-  are  for  movements

They  can  be  swapped  in  the  option  menu

-E-  is  to  interact  with  people  or  elements

-A-  is  to  attack

I  think  that s  all  for  me  then

Maybe  this  old  wizzard  over  there  has  something  to  tell  you
#
You  must  be  the  Hero  if  you  are  just  getting  out  of  this  home

I  am  Merlin  the  village  elder

We  villagers  have  prayed  for  you

The  village  is  threatened  by  a  mighty  dragon

It  just  flew  here  a  few  months  ago  and  started  to  destroy

everything  around  looking  for  some  gold  or  so

Please  save  us  all  from  it  before  he  gets  to  the  village

Go  get  this  Green  Dragon

#
What  a  beautiful  weather
#
Have  you  seen  the  beast  flying  around  ?
#
There  is  strange  monsters  near  the  village...
#
Oh  saints  who  are  you  ?
#
My  big  cat  is  always  hungry
#
- THE  END -

You  finally  did  it

You  defeated  the  Green  dragon

Thank  to  you  the  village  will  be  able  to  start  over  their

usual  lives

You  saved  us  all  Link

You  are  a  true  Hero
